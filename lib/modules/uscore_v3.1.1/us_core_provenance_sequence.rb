        # Background

        The US Core #{title} sequence verifies that the system under test is able to provide correct responses
        for Provenance queries.  These queries must contain resources conforming to US Core Provenance Profile as specified
        in the US Core v3.1.1 Implementation Guide.

        # Testing Methodology


        Previously run sequences store references to US Core Provenance resources that are associated with other US Core
        resources using the appropriate `_revincludes` search.  This set of tests uses these found resources to verify
        support for the `read` operation.  Each of these resources must conform to the US Core Provenance profile.

        ## Must Support
        Each profile has a list of elements marked as "must support". This test sequence expects to see each of these elements
        at least once. If at least one cannot be found, the test will fail. The test will look through the Provenance
        resources found for these elements.

        ## Profile Validation
        Each resource returned from the first search is expected to conform to the [US Core Provenance Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-provenance).
        Each element is checked against teminology binding and cardinality requirements.

        Elements with a required binding is validated against its bound valueset. If the code/system in the element is not part
        of the valueset, then the test will fail.

        ## Reference Validation
        Each reference within the resources found from the first search must resolve. The test will attempt to read each reference found
        and will fail if any attempted read fails.
