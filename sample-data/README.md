Sample Data
===========

Files contained in this folder provide a small set of test data, in JSON format, for each FHIR Resource 
identiied in the Argonaut profile.  The process of importing the data into a test server
may be done in a variety of ways, but using the FHIR create interaction is a likely option.

This data was sourced from these two open test FHIR servers:


   https://portal.demo.syncfor.science/api/open-fhir/metadata?_format=json
   https://open-ic.epic.com/FHIR/api/FHIR/DSTU2/metadata?_format=json


Use of these servers does not imply endorsement or adherence to any specific profile.


The data is divided into folders based on its FHIR resource type.
Please import the Patient resources and Medication resources prior to importing the other resources.
